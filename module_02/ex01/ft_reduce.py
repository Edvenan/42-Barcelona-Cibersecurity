'''
The goal of the exercise is to work on the built-in functions map, filter and reduce.

Implement the functions ft_map, ft_filter and ft_reduce. Take the time to under-
stand the use cases of these two built-in functions (map and filter) and the function
reduce in functools module. You are not expected to code specific classes to create
ft_map, ft_filter or ft_reduce objects, take a closer look to the examples to know
what to do.


You are expected to produce the raise of exception for the functions similar to ex-
ceptions of map, filter and reduce when wrong parameters are given (but no need to
reproduce the exact the same exception messages).
